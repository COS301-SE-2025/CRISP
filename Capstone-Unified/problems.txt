CRISP Platform - Issues Identified
========================================

CRITICAL ISSUES
===============

1. IOC MANAGEMENT PAGE PERFORMANCE ISSUE
   - Problem: IoCs Management page loads ALL indicators at once, making 42+ sequential API requests
   - Pattern: GET /api/indicators/?page=1&page_size=100 through page=42 (4,200+ indicators)
   - Impact: Severe performance degradation, slow page loads, excessive server load
   - Root Cause: Frontend implements eager loading instead of on-demand pagination
   - Location: IoCs Management frontend component
   - Each request ~38KB, total ~1.6MB of data transferred unnecessarily

2. DATABASE INTEGRITY VIOLATIONS
   - Problem: When consuming large threat feeds, duplicate STIX IDs cause infinite database constraint violations
   - Error: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint 'indicators_stix_id_key'"
   - Impact: Application becomes completely unusable, shows as "offline", and floods logs with errors
   - Root Cause: STIX parser attempts to create indicators that already exist instead of updating them
   - Location: core/parsers/stix1_parser.py line 280

2. PAGE ROUTING/NAVIGATION PERSISTENCE
   - Problem: Reloading any page redirects user back to dashboard regardless of current page
   - Impact: Users lose their place and cannot bookmark specific pages
   - Expected: Page should reload to the same location where user was working
   - Current State: All page refreshes → Dashboard

3. FEED CONSUMPTION CROSS-CONTAMINATION
   - Problem: Different threat feeds may be pulling from the same underlying source (AlienVault OTX)
   - Impact: Consuming multiple feeds may result in duplicate data and database conflicts
   - Testing Needed: Consume Feed A, then Feed B, verify indicators appear correctly on IoCs and Dashboard
   - Concern: Multiple feeds configured with same TAXII endpoints causing data overlap


HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES
===================

4. PAGE ROUTING/NAVIGATION PERSISTENCE
   - Problem: Reloading any page redirects user back to dashboard regardless of current page
   - Impact: Users lose their place and cannot bookmark specific pages
   - Expected: Page should reload to the same location where user was working
   - Current State: All page refreshes → Dashboard

5. THREAT FEED DELETION INCONSISTENCY
   - Problem: Deleting threat feeds shows success but items remain visible in UI
   - Secondary Issue: Attempting to delete the same feed again produces error
   - Impact: Users cannot properly manage their feed inventory
   - UI State: Inconsistent between backend deletion and frontend display

5. SESSION MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS
   - Problem: Users are automatically logged out regardless of activity level
   - Current Behavior: Forced logout occurs even when user is actively working
   - Expected Behavior: Session timeout should be based on inactivity period
   - Desired Solution: Implement "Are you still there?" modal with inactivity timer (similar to TUKS system)

6. NOTIFICATION SYSTEM FAILURES
   - Problem: Notification functionality is completely non-functional
   - Specific Issues:
     * Clearing notifications has no effect
     * Reading notifications doesn't update status
     * Notifications reset when page is refreshed
     * All notification data appears to be mock/placeholder data
   - Impact: Users cannot receive important system updates or alerts


MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES
=====================

7. BROWSER NAVIGATION (BACK BUTTON)
   - Problem: Browser back button doesn't return user to previous location within the application
   - Impact: Poor user experience, breaks expected browser behavior
   - Current State: Back button behavior is unpredictable

8. TTP DATA MANAGEMENT
   - Problem: TTP editing functionality is incomplete
   - Specific Areas:
     * Database updates may not persist properly
     * Changes don't reflect immediately on webpage
     * Edit forms may not populate correctly with existing data
   - Impact: Users cannot maintain accurate TTP information

9. DATA EXPORT FUNCTIONALITY
   - Problem: TTP data export formats are inconsistent
   - Working: JSON export functions correctly
   - Broken: STIX and CSV export formats fail
   - Impact: Users cannot extract data in required formats for sharing/analysis

10. TRUST RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT
    - Problem: Trust relationship viewing and editing is non-functional on organizations page
    - Location: Navbar → Organizations → Trust relationships
    - Impact: Core trust management features are inaccessible

11. ALERT SYSTEM TESTING
    - Problem: Alert functionality has not been properly tested
    - Areas Needing Verification:
      * Alert generation triggers
      * Alert delivery mechanisms
      * Alert acknowledgment system
      * Lack of alerts when expected
    - Risk: Critical security events may go unnoticed


LOW PRIORITY / ENHANCEMENT ISSUES
=================================

12. NOTIFICATION SYSTEM INTEGRATION
    - Problem: No testing of cross-institutional notification receiving
    - Need: Verify notifications from external organizations work properly
    - Impact: Inter-organizational communication may be broken

13. IOC SHARING CAPABILITIES
    - Problem: Share URL and IoC sharing functionality untested
    - Components to Test:
      * Share URL generation
      * Share permissions
      * Recipient access to shared indicators
    - Impact: Collaboration features may not work as intended

14. BACKGROUND REFRESH SYSTEM
    - Problem: Auto-refresh functionality needs comprehensive testing
    - Concern: Background updates may not work reliably
    - Impact: Users may miss real-time threat intelligence updates

15. USER INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS
    - Problem: JavaScript alerts are used for user notifications
    - Current State: Browser-native alert() popups
    - Desired State: Professional in-application notification system
    - Impact: Poor user experience and unprofessional appearance

16. CHART RENDERING ISSUES
    - Problem: Frequency graphs display "should render" message but don't actually render
    - Affected Components: Various analytics and dashboard charts
    - Impact: Users cannot visualize threat intelligence data properly

17. REPORTS SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
    - Problem: Reports functionality is incomplete
    - Specific Issues:
      * Report generation only shows visual confirmation, doesn't store in database
      * Generated reports are not persistent
      * Filter functionality not implemented on reports page
    - Impact: Users cannot generate meaningful threat intelligence reports

18. SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
    - Problem: "Search platform" search bar in header is not implemented
    - Current State: UI element exists but no functionality
    - Impact: Users cannot search across platform content

19. THREAT FEED DATA SOURCES
    - Problem: Need threat feeds with extractable TTP data for comprehensive testing
    - Current State: Waiting on Ivan's threat feeds with TTP data
    - Impact: Cannot fully test TTP extraction and analysis capabilities


TESTING REQUIREMENTS
====================

The following areas require systematic testing:
- Cross-feed consumption without data conflicts
- Notification system end-to-end functionality
- Alert generation and delivery
- Inter-organizational data sharing
- Session timeout behavior under various usage patterns
- Data export in all supported formats
- Trust relationship CRUD operations
- Real-time UI updates across all components
- Chart rendering across different data sets
- Report generation and persistence


TECHNICAL DEBT
===============

- Inconsistent error handling between components
- Mock data still present in production-ready features
- Incomplete integration between frontend and backend for several features
- Session management implementation needs modernization
- Navigation state management requires improvement
