# CRISP Security Assessment Summary

**Date:** Tue Aug 19 19:34:27 SAST 2025
**Target Applications:**
- Django Backend: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Vite Frontend: http://127.0.0.1:5173

## Tests Performed

### 1. Static Code Analysis (Bandit)
- **Purpose:** Identify insecure code patterns in Django codebase
- **Files Analyzed:** Core Django application files
- **Report:** bandit_report.html, bandit_report.json, bandit_report.txt

### 2. Web Server Vulnerability Scanning (Nikto)
- **Purpose:** Scan for misconfigurations and known vulnerabilities
- **Targets:** Both Django and Vite servers
- **Reports:** nikto_django_report.html, nikto_vite_report.html

### 3. Web Application Security Testing (OWASP ZAP)
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive web application security testing
- **Tests:** Spider crawling, Active security scanning
- **Vulnerabilities Tested:** XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, Security Headers
- **Reports:** zap_django_report.html, zap_vite_report.html

### 4. SQL Injection Testing (sqlmap)
- **Purpose:** Automated SQL injection vulnerability detection
- **Endpoints Tested:** API authentication and data endpoints
- **Report Directory:** sqlmap/

### 5. Brute Force Testing (Hydra)
- **Purpose:** Test authentication mechanisms against brute force attacks
- **Targets:** Login endpoints and admin interfaces
- **Reports:** hydra_login_report.txt, hydra_admin_report.txt

## Vulnerability Categories Tested

- **Injection Attacks:** SQL injection, Command injection, LDAP injection
- **Authentication Issues:** Weak passwords, Brute force resistance
- **Session Management:** Session fixation, Session hijacking
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Security Misconfigurations:** Default credentials, Unnecessary services
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Unencrypted data, Information leakage
- **Broken Access Control:** Privilege escalation, Path traversal
- **Security Headers:** Missing security headers
- **Known Vulnerabilities:** CVE-based vulnerability checks

## Next Steps

1. Review all generated reports in detail
2. Prioritize vulnerabilities by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
3. Create remediation plan for identified issues
4. Implement security fixes
5. Re-run tests to validate fixes
6. Consider implementing continuous security testing

## Important Notes

- All tests were performed against LOCAL development environment only
- Results should be validated manually before implementing fixes
- Some findings may be false positives - manual verification recommended
- Consider professional penetration testing for production systems
