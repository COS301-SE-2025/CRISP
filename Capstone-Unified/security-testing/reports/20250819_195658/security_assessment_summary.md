# CRISP Security Assessment Summary - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

**Date:** Tue Aug 19 20:46:12 SAST 2025
**Target Applications:**
- Django Backend: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Vite Frontend: http://127.0.0.1:5173

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FINDINGS üö®

### 1. WEAK AUTHENTICATION CREDENTIALS DETECTED
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete system compromise possible  
**Finding:** Default/weak credentials discovered
- **Username:** admin  
- **Password:** password  
- **Location:** Django authentication system  

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Change the admin password immediately
2. Implement strong password policies
3. Enable multi-factor authentication
4. Review all user accounts for weak passwords

## Tests Performed

### 1. Static Code Analysis (Bandit)
- **Purpose:** Identify insecure code patterns in Django codebase
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Completed
- **Report:** bandit_report.html, bandit_report.json, bandit_report.txt

### 2. Web Server Vulnerability Scanning (Nikto)
- **Purpose:** Scan for misconfigurations and known vulnerabilities
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  
- **Reports:** nikto_django_report.html, nikto_vite_report.html

### 3. Web Application Security Testing (OWASP ZAP)
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive web application security testing
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Completed (Fixed configuration issues)
- **Reports:** zap_django_report.html, zap_vite_report.html

### 4. SQL Injection Testing (sqlmap)
- **Purpose:** Automated SQL injection vulnerability detection
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Completed (Gentle testing to avoid server crashes)
- **Report Directory:** sqlmap/

### 5. Brute Force Testing (Hydra)
- **Purpose:** Test authentication mechanisms against brute force attacks
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Completed - **CRITICAL FINDING DETECTED**
- **Reports:** hydra_login_report.txt, hydra_admin_report.txt

## Immediate Security Actions Required

### Priority 1 (CRITICAL - Fix Immediately)
1. **Change admin password** from "password" to a strong, unique password
2. **Review all user accounts** for weak/default passwords
3. **Implement password complexity requirements**
4. **Enable account lockout** after failed login attempts

### Priority 2 (HIGH - Fix Within 24 Hours)
1. Review static code analysis findings from Bandit
2. Address missing security headers identified by Nikto
3. Fix any XSS/CSRF vulnerabilities found by ZAP

### Priority 3 (MEDIUM - Fix Within Week)
1. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
2. Regular security assessment schedule
3. Security awareness training for development team

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATELY** change weak passwords
2. Review detailed reports for additional vulnerabilities  
3. Create remediation timeline for all findings
4. Implement security fixes in development environment first
5. Re-run security tests to validate fixes
6. Consider professional penetration testing

## Security Recommendations

- Implement CI/CD security scanning
- Regular security assessments (monthly)
- Security code reviews for all changes
- Incident response plan
- Security awareness training
