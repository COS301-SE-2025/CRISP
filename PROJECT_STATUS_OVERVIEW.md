# CRISP Trust Management Platform - Project Overview & Status

## 🎯 Project Overview

**CRISP** (Cyber Threat Intelligence Resource Sharing Platform) is a comprehensive trust management platform designed for secure cyber threat intelligence sharing between organizations. The platform implements sophisticated trust-based access controls, anonymization capabilities, and multi-organizational data sharing mechanisms.

### Core Purpose
- Enable secure sharing of cyber threat intelligence between organizations
- Implement trust-based access control mechanisms
- Provide data anonymization and privacy protection
- Support multi-organizational collaboration on cybersecurity threats
- Ensure data integrity and audit trails for all sharing activities

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Django-based REST API with trust management core
- **Trust System**: Hierarchical trust levels, relationship management, group-based sharing
- **User Management**: Multi-organizational user authentication and role-based access control
- **Data Pipeline**: Anonymization, consumption, and publication workflows
- **Security**: Comprehensive audit logging, rate limiting, input validation

## 🏗️ System Components

### 1. Trust Management System (`core/trust/`)
- **Trust Levels**: Hierarchical trust scoring (none, low, medium, high, complete)
- **Trust Relationships**: Bilateral/multilateral relationships between organizations
- **Trust Groups**: Community-based sharing groups with configurable policies
- **Sharing Policies**: Resource-specific access control rules
- **Trust Logs**: Comprehensive audit trail for all trust-related activities

### 2. User Management System (`core/user_management/`)
- **Multi-Organizational Users**: Users belonging to different organizations
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, Publisher, Viewer roles with hierarchical permissions
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication with 2FA support
- **Organization Management**: Organization creation, configuration, and trust metrics
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with device trust

### 3. Security & Audit (`core/middleware/`, `core/services/`)
- **Audit Middleware**: Automatic request/response logging for sensitive endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and security validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: HMAC signature validation for sensitive operations

### 4. Data Processing Pipeline (Separate Branch)
- **Anonymization Engine**: Privacy-preserving data transformation
- **Consumption Module**: Data ingestion from external sources
- **Publication Module**: Controlled data publishing with trust-based access
