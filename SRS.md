## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Business Need
Educational institutions face increasing cyber threats with limited resources for threat intelligence sharing. Recent months have shown a disturbing trend where once an educational Institution is attacked, similar institutions often become subsequent targets. CRISP addresses the critical need for timely and effective information sharing regarding cyber security incidents among educational institutions, enabling proactive defense against emerging threats.

### 1.2 Project Scope
CRISP will provide a web-based platform for BlueVision ITM to serve their clients with:
- Secure threat intelligence sharing using industry standards (STIX/TAXII)
- Anonymization of sensitive Institutional data while preserving analytical value
- Integration with external threat intelligence sources
- Real-time threat alerting and notification systems
- Trust-based access control and data sharing between Institutions
- Autonomous sharing between distributed CRISP instances
- **Comprehensive multi-tenant user management with advanced authentication**
- **Role-based access control with organization-specific permissions**
- **Advanced session management and security controls**
- **Comprehensive audit trails and compliance features**

The platform will facilitate both consumption of external threat feeds and publication of anonymized threat data, ensuring confidentiality while maximizing the benefit of shared intelligence.
