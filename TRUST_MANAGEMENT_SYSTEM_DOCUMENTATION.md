## System Overview

The Trust Management System is a comprehensive Django application designed to manage trust relationships between organizations in a cybersecurity intelligence sharing platform. It implements multiple design patterns and provides a robust foundation for trust-based access control, intelligence filtering, and audit logging.

**Current Status:** Foundation implemented with data models and basic services. Business logic and integration layers need completion.

**Architecture:** Django application with clean separation of concerns:
- **Models**: Data persistence and business entities
- **Services**: Business logic and workflows
- **Patterns**: Design pattern implementations (Factory, Decorator, Repository, Observer, Strategy)
- **Validation**: Custom validation logic
- **Integration**: Event handling and external system integration

## Design Patterns

### Decorator Pattern

**Location:** `core/trust/patterns/decorator/trust_decorators.py`

**Purpose:** Enhances trust evaluation logic dynamically by wrapping core evaluation components with additional functionalities like security checks, compliance validation, and audit logging. This allows for flexible and extensible trust decision-making without modifying the core evaluation logic.

**Key Classes:**

#### `TrustEvaluationComponent` (Abstract Base Class)
**Purpose:** Defines the common interface for trust evaluation components that can be decorated.
**Methods:**
- `evaluate(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Evaluates a trust access request.
- `get_access_level(self) -> str`: Returns the access level for this evaluation.

#### `BasicTrustEvaluation`
**Purpose:** A concrete implementation of `TrustEvaluationComponent` that performs a basic trust evaluation based on an existing `TrustRelationship`.
**Methods:**
- `evaluate(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Checks if a trust relationship exists and is effective, returning an initial access decision.
- `get_access_level(self) -> str`: Retrieves the effective access level from the associated `TrustRelationship`.

#### `TrustEvaluationDecorator` (Abstract Base Class)
**Purpose:** The abstract base decorator class that implements the `TrustEvaluationComponent` interface and holds a reference to the wrapped component.
**Methods:**
- `evaluate(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`: Delegates the evaluation to the wrapped component.
- `get_access_level(self) -> str`: Delegates the access level retrieval to the wrapped component.

#### `SecurityEnhancementDecorator`
**Purpose:** A concrete decorator that adds security checks to the trust evaluation.
**Features:**
- Checks for excessive failed login attempts.
- Warns about requests outside business hours.
- Enhances anonymization for high-security contexts.
**Integration Points:** Can be chained with other decorators to add security layers.

#### `ComplianceDecorator`
**Purpose:** A concrete decorator that adds regulatory compliance validation to the trust evaluation.
**Features:**
- Checks data retention requirements.
- Validates anonymization for sensitive data types.
**Integration Points:** Ensures trust decisions align with compliance frameworks.

#### `AuditDecorator`
**Purpose:** A concrete decorator that adds comprehensive audit logging to trust decisions.
**Features:**
- Records evaluation duration and timestamp.
- Logs detailed audit entries, sanitizing sensitive context data.
**Integration Points:** Provides an auditable trail for all trust evaluations.

#### `TrustDecoratorChain`
**Purpose:** A builder class that provides a fluent interface for constructing and applying multiple decorators to a `BasicTrustEvaluation` component.
**Methods:**
- `add_security_enhancement()`: Adds `SecurityEnhancementDecorator`.
- `add_compliance_validation()`: Adds `ComplianceDecorator`.
- `add_audit_logging()`: Adds `AuditDecorator`.
- `build()`: Returns the final decorated `TrustEvaluationComponent`.
- `evaluate()`: Convenience method to evaluate the built chain.

**Integration Points:**
- Used when a trust evaluation needs to incorporate multiple cross-cutting concerns (security, compliance, auditing).
- The `build()` method returns a `TrustEvaluationComponent` that can be used directly in services or API endpoints.

**Missing Features:**
- ❌ Dynamic loading of decorators based on configuration.
- ❌ More sophisticated security checks (e.g., geo-fencing, device posture).
- ❌ Integration with external compliance engines.
- ❌ Customizable audit log destinations.

### Factory Pattern

**Location:** `core/trust/patterns/factory/trust_factory.py`

**Purpose:** Provides a centralized and standardized way to create instances of core trust management objects (`TrustRelationship`, `TrustGroup`, `TrustLog`). This decouples the client code from the concrete classes, making the system more flexible and easier to extend with new object types.

**Key Classes:**

#### `TrustObjectCreator` (Abstract Base Class)
**Purpose:** Defines the abstract interface for all concrete creators.
**Methods:**
- `create(self, **kwargs) -> Any`: Abstract method to create a trust management object.

#### `TrustRelationshipCreator`
**Purpose:** Concrete creator for `TrustRelationship` objects.
**Features:**
- Sets default values for relationship properties (e.g., `relationship_type`, `status`, `anonymization_level`).
- Ensures proper initialization of `TrustRelationship` instances.

#### `TrustGroupCreator`
**Purpose:** Concrete creator for `TrustGroup` objects.
**Features:**
- Sets default values for group properties (e.g., `group_type`, `is_public`, `requires_approval`).
- Automatically adds the creator as an administrator.

#### `TrustLogCreator`
**Purpose:** Concrete creator for `TrustLog` entries.
**Features:**
- Standardizes the creation of audit log entries with common fields.
- Ensures consistency in logging trust-related actions.

#### `TrustFactory`
**Purpose:** The main factory class that acts as a facade, providing a unified interface for creating all types of trust management objects. It holds instances of the concrete creators.
**Methods:**
- `create_relationship(...)`: Delegates to `TrustRelationshipCreator`.
- `create_group(...)`: Delegates to `TrustGroupCreator`.
- `create_log(...)`: Delegates to `TrustLogCreator`.

**Integration Points:**
- Used by services (e.g., `TrustService`, `TrustGroupService`) to create new instances of models.
- Ensures that objects are created with consistent default values and proper initialization.
- The global instance `trust_factory` is available for easy access throughout the application.

**Missing Features:**
- ❌ Support for custom object creation logic based on runtime conditions.
- ❌ Integration with a configuration system to define default values externally.
- ❌ Factory for `TrustLevel` or `TrustGroupMembership` if their creation logic becomes complex.

- `delete(self, entity_id: str)`: Deletes an entity (often a soft delete).
- `exists(self, **kwargs) -> bool`: Checks if an entity exists based on criteria.
- `count(self, **kwargs) -> int`: Counts entities matching criteria.

#### `TrustRelationshipRepository`
**Purpose:** Concrete repository for `TrustRelationship` entities.
**Features:**
- Provides methods for creating, updating, soft-deleting, and querying trust relationships.
- Includes specific query methods like `get_by_organizations`, `get_for_organization`, `get_effective_relationships`, `get_pending_approvals`, `get_expiring_soon`, and `get_statistics`.
- Uses Django's ORM for database interactions, including `select_related` for optimized queries and `transaction.atomic` for data integrity.

#### `TrustGroupRepository`
**Purpose:** Concrete repository for `TrustGroup` entities.
**Features:**
- Provides CRUD operations for trust groups.
- Includes methods like `get_public_groups`, `get_groups_for_organization`, and `can_administer`.

#### `TrustLevelRepository`
**Purpose:** Concrete repository for `TrustLevel` entities.
**Features:**
- Provides CRUD operations for trust levels.
- Includes methods like `get_by_name`, `get_default`, and `get_by_score_range`.

#### `TrustLogRepository`
**Purpose:** Concrete repository for `TrustLog` entities.
**Features:**
- Provides methods for creating and querying audit logs.
- **Important:** `update` and `delete` methods are explicitly `NotImplementedError` as trust logs are designed to be immutable.
- Includes query methods like `get_for_organization`, `get_by_action`, and `get_failed_actions`.

#### `TrustRepositoryManager`
**Purpose:** A facade class that provides unified access to all individual trust repositories. It acts as a central point for interacting with the data access layer.
**Features:**
- Holds instances of `TrustRelationshipRepository`, `TrustGroupRepository`, `TrustLevelRepository`, and `TrustLogRepository`.
- `get_repository(entity_type: str)`: Returns the appropriate repository based on entity type.
- `create_with_logging(entity_type: str, user: str, **kwargs)`: A convenience method to create an entity and automatically log the creation (or failure) using the `TrustLogRepository`.
- The global instance `trust_repository_manager` is available for easy access.

**Integration Points:**
- Used extensively by the Services Layer to interact with the database.
- Decouples business logic from ORM specifics, allowing for easier migration to different data stores if needed.
- Centralizes data access logic, promoting consistency and reusability.

**Missing Features:**
- ❌ More advanced query capabilities (e.g., complex joins, subqueries not directly supported by ORM).
- ❌ Caching mechanisms within repositories for frequently accessed data.
- ❌ Support for different data sources (e.g., NoSQL databases) without significant changes to the service layer.

### Observer Pattern

**Location:** `core/trust/patterns/observer/trust_observers.py`

**Purpose:** Implements a publish-subscribe mechanism for trust-related events. When a significant event occurs (e.g., relationship created, group joined, access granted/denied), the `TrustEventManager` (Subject) notifies all registered `TrustObserver` (Observers). This promotes loose coupling between components and allows for easy extension of event-driven functionalities.

**Key Classes:**

#### `TrustObserver` (Abstract Base Class)
**Purpose:** Defines the interface for all concrete observers.
**Methods:**
- `update(self, event_type: str, event_data: Dict[str, Any])`: Handles trust-related event notifications.

#### `TrustNotificationObserver`
**Purpose:** Sends notifications (e.g., email, webhooks) to relevant parties when trust events occur.
**Features:**
- Contains placeholder methods for various notification types (`_notify_relationship_created`, `_notify_relationship_approved`, etc.).
- Logs notification details for audit purposes.

#### `TrustMetricsObserver`
**Purpose:** Collects trust relationship metrics and statistics.
**Features:**
- Records event types and associated data.
- Placeholder for sending metrics to monitoring systems.

#### `TrustAuditObserver`
**Purpose:** Maintains detailed audit logs for trust operations.
**Features:**
- Creates `TrustLog` entries for various trust events.
- Maps event types to appropriate audit log actions.

#### `TrustSecurityObserver`
**Purpose:** Monitors trust relationships for security anomalies.
**Features:**
- Checks for suspicious access denial patterns.
- Monitors trust revocation patterns.
- Handles suspicious access attempts (e.g., multiple failed attempts).

#### `TrustEventManager`
**Purpose:** The Subject in the Observer pattern. Manages the registration and notification of observers.
**Features:**
- `add_observer(observer: TrustObserver)`: Registers an observer.
- `remove_observer(observer: TrustObserver)`: Unregisters an observer.
- `notify_observers(event_type: str, event_data: Dict[str, Any])`: Notifies all registered observers of an event.
- Sets up default observers (`TrustNotificationObserver`, `TrustMetricsObserver`, `TrustAuditObserver`, `TrustSecurityObserver`) upon initialization.
- The global instance `trust_event_manager` is available for use.

**Integration Points:**
- Django Signal Handlers: `post_save` and `pre_save` signals for `TrustRelationship` and `TrustGroupMembership` are connected to the `trust_event_manager` to trigger notifications.
- Convenience functions (`notify_access_event`, `notify_trust_relationship_event`) are provided to simplify event notification from other parts of the system (e.g., services).
- Allows for easy addition of new event-driven functionalities (e.g., real-time analytics, external system synchronization) without modifying existing code.

**Missing Features:**
- ❌ Asynchronous event processing for performance.
- ❌ Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for observer failures.
- ❌ Dynamic observer registration/unregistration via configuration.
- ❌ Integration with a dedicated message queue for event distribution.

## System Components

### Validators

**Location:** `core/trust/validators.py`

**Purpose:** Provides a set of static methods for validating various aspects of trust management operations, including data integrity, business rules, and security constraints. This ensures that data entering the system is clean, consistent, and adheres to defined policies.

**Key Classes:**

#### `TrustRelationshipValidator`
**Purpose:** Validates operations related to `TrustRelationship` creation, approval, and revocation.
**Methods:**
- `validate_create_relationship(...)`: Ensures required fields are present, organizations are different, and UUIDs are valid.
- `validate_approve_relationship(...)`: Validates relationship ID, approving organization, and user.
- `validate_revoke_relationship(...)`: Validates relationship ID, revoking organization, and user.

#### `TrustGroupValidator`
**Purpose:** Validates operations related to `TrustGroup` creation and membership.
**Methods:**
- `validate_create_group(...)`: Ensures name and description meet length requirements, creator organization UUID is valid, and group type is valid.
- `validate_join_group(...)`: Validates group ID, organization ID, and membership type.

#### `AccessControlValidator`
**Purpose:** Validates the configuration of sharing policies.
**Methods:**
- `validate_sharing_policy(...)`: Checks for required fields, valid resource types, and allowed actions within a sharing policy.

#### `SecurityValidator`
**Purpose:** Provides a range of security-focused validation methods.
**Methods:**
- `validate_input_sanitization(...)`: Cleans input strings by removing potentially dangerous characters and checks for script injection attempts.
- `validate_rate_limiting(...)`: Implements basic rate limiting using Django's cache.
- `validate_suspicious_patterns(...)`: Detects unusual timing patterns and rapid-fire operations.
- `validate_cryptographic_integrity(...)`: Validates data integrity using HMAC signatures (requires `TRUST_MANAGEMENT_SECRET_KEY` setting).
- `validate_temporal_security(...)`: Checks for replay attacks by validating operation timestamps.
- `validate_trust_escalation(...)`: Warns/errors on significant trust level escalation attempts.
- `validate_anonymization_downgrade(...)`: Warns/errors on anonymization level downgrade attempts.
- `validate_api_request(...)`: A comprehensive method to validate API request data by combining input sanitization, suspicious pattern detection, and temporal security validation.
- `record_security_event(...)`: Records security events as `TrustLog` entries for monitoring.

#### `validate_trust_operation` (Main Validation Function)
**Purpose:** A central function that orchestrates various validation checks for a given trust operation.
**Features:**
- Applies input sanitization, rate limiting, and suspicious pattern detection.
- Delegates to operation-specific validators (`TrustRelationshipValidator`, `TrustGroupValidator`).
- Records security events if errors or warnings are detected.

**Integration Points:**
- Should be called at the entry points of all trust-related API endpoints and service methods to ensure data validity and security.
- Provides a robust first line of defense against invalid or malicious input.
- The `SecurityValidator` methods can be used independently for specific security checks.

**Missing Features:**
- ❌ More sophisticated input validation (e.g., schema validation for complex JSON fields).
- ❌ Integration with external security scanning tools.
- ❌ Dynamic configuration of validation rules.
- ❌ Centralized error reporting and alerting for validation failures.
