# User Story: Comprehensive User Management and Authentication System

## Overview

As a CRISP platform stakeholder (System Administrator, Organization Administrator, or Platform User),
I want a robust, secure, and scalable user management system that handles authentication, authorization, session management, and audit capabilities
So that the platform can securely manage user access to threat intelligence data while maintaining compliance, security standards, and operational efficiency across multiple organizations.

## User Roles

**System Administrator (BlueVisionAdmin)**: Platform-wide administrators who manage system settings, organizations, and have unrestricted access to all user management functions
**Organization Administrator**: Institution representatives who manage users within their organization and configure organization-specific policies
**Publisher**: Users who can create and share threat intelligence feeds with appropriate permissions
**Viewer**: Standard users who can access and consume threat intelligence data based on their permissions

## Narrative

The CRISP platform requires a comprehensive user management system that supports multi-tenant operations across different organizations while maintaining strict security controls. The system must provide flexible authentication mechanisms including standard login, two-factor authentication, and trusted device management. Each organization needs the ability to manage their own users while system administrators maintain oversight of the entire platform. The system must track all authentication events, manage user sessions, enforce account security policies, and provide comprehensive audit trails for compliance and security monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

Organizations have unique identifiers, names, and email domains
Domain-based user assignment during registration

#### AC5.2 - Organization-Based User Isolation (Functional)
Users can only see and interact with users from their organization (except system admins)
Organization administrators cannot access users from other organizations
Data and permissions are scoped to organization boundaries
Cross-organization data sharing requires explicit permissions
