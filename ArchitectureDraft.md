## 10. Architectural Structural Design & Requirements

### 10. System Architecture Overview

The threat intelligence platform employs a **hybrid architectural approach** combining **N-tier layered architecture** with **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** principles and **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** patterns.

#### 10.1 Architectural Layers

The system is structured across four distinct layers:

**Presentation Layer** implements the MVC pattern with View components for user interface rendering and Controller components handling authentication, authorization, threat detection, and user management. This separation ensures clean presentation logic and robust security controls.

**Business Logic Layer** adopts SOA principles through specialized microservices including STIX/TAXII Service for threat data standardization, Alert Service for real-time notifications, Threat Intelligence Service for data analysis, and supporting services for organization management, anonymization, authentication, and trust relationships.

**Data Access Layer** implements the Repository pattern with dedicated repositories for each domain entity (Indicators, ThreatFeeds, TTPs, Organizations, Users, Audit logs). This abstraction provides consistent data access interfaces and enables easier testing and maintenance.

**Data Layer** centralizes persistent storage using institution, threat feed, indicator, TTP, and trust group models, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

#### 10.2 Architectural Justification

The **N-tier architecture** provides clear separation of concerns, enabling independent scaling and maintenance of each layer. **SOA implementation** allows individual services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, crucial for a threat intelligence platform requiring high availability and performance.

**External Systems Integration** through dedicated interfaces (Celery for background processing, Redis for caching, SMTP for notifications, and external threat feeds) ensures loose coupling and system reliability.

This hybrid approach delivers scalability, maintainability, security, and performance required for enterprise threat intelligence operations.
