# User Story: Comprehensive User Management and Authentication System

## Overview

As a CRISP platform stakeholder (System Administrator, Organization Administrator, or Platform User),
I want a robust, secure, and scalable user management system that handles authentication, authorization, session management, and audit capabilities
So that the platform can securely manage user access to threat intelligence data while maintaining compliance, security standards, and operational efficiency across multiple organizations.

## User Roles

**BlueVisionAdmin**: Platform-wide administrators who can access and change everything across all organizations
**Publisher**: Institution heads who can create users within their institution and have all viewer functionality
**Viewer**: Standard users who can consume threat feeds but cannot create, remove or edit any users or institutions

## Narrative

The CRISP platform requires a comprehensive user management system that supports multi-tenant operations across different organizations while maintaining strict security controls. The system must provide flexible authentication mechanisms including standard login, two-factor authentication, and trusted device management. Each organization needs the ability to manage their own users while system administrators maintain oversight of the entire platform. The system must track all authentication events, manage user sessions, enforce account security policies, and provide comprehensive audit trails for compliance and security monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
