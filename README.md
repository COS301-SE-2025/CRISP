## üéØ Project Overview

CRISP addresses the critical need for timely and effective information sharing regarding cybersecurity incidents. By providing a platform for sharing Indicators of Compromise (IoC), Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) used by threat actors, as well as mitigation and eradication strategies, CRISP enables institutions to proactively defend against emerging threats.

Inspired by the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) and the CIRCL information sharing community, CRISP serves as BlueVision ITM's solution for providing threat intelligence to clients and partners.

### Key Features

- **Secure Threat Intelligence Sharing** - Standardized threat sharing protocols (STIX/TAXII)
- **Web-based Interface** - Remote access for threat data visualization and management
- **Autonomous Sharing** - Distributed CRISP servers with automated intelligence exchange
- **Data Anonymization** - Configurable anonymization to protect sensitive information
- **External Integration** - Compatible with MISP and other threat intelligence platforms

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Patterns

CRISP implements several design patterns for a flexible, maintainable, and extensible architecture:

- **Factory Method Pattern** - For STIX object creation and standardization
- **Observer Pattern** - Real-time threat feed notifications
- **Strategy Pattern** - Flexible data anonymization approaches
- **Adapter Pattern** - Integration with external threat intelligence sources
- **Decorator Pattern** - Enhanced STIX object capabilities
- **Facade Pattern** - Simplified system interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python** - Core backend development and data processing
- **Django/Django REST Framework** - Web framework and API services
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database for structured data
- **RabbitMQ** - Message broker for distributed communication

### Security & Threat Intelligence
- **OpenCTI** - Open source threat intelligence platform
- **PyMISP** - MISP integration library
- **STIX2/TAXII2** - Industry-standard threat sharing protocols
- **JWT** - Secure API authentication

### Frontend
- **React.js** - User interface development
- **D3.js** - Data visualization and threat actor network mapping
- **Material-UI** - Professional UI components

### DevOps & Security
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerization and orchestration
- **Nginx** - Web server and reverse proxy
- **OWASP ZAP** - Security testing
- **HashiCorp Vault** - Secrets management

## GitFlow Branching Strategy

Our team follows the GitFlow branching model to ensure organized, secure, and collaborative development for the CRISP platform. This strategy aligns with our security-first development approach and supports our 2-week sprint cycles.
Key Branches:

 - **Main/Master:** Production-ready code with stable releases
 - **Develop:** Integration branch for ongoing development work
 - **Feature branches:** Individual features developed in isolation (feature/*)
 - **Release branches:** Preparation for production releases (release/*)
 - **Hotfix branches:** Critical fixes for production issues (hotfix/*)
