# CRISP - External TAXII 2.1 Threat Intelligence Feed Consumption

## Overview

This Django application focuses on consuming external TAXII 2.1 compliant threat intelligence feeds for the CRISP (Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform) system. The component enables organizations to automatically retrieve, process, and store standardized threat intelligence from external sources such as AlienVault OTX.

The feed consumption component addresses a critical need in cybersecurity: staying updated with the latest threat intelligence. By automating the consumption of standardized TAXII feeds, organizations can maintain awareness of emerging threats without manual intervention.

## What is TAXII?

TAXII (Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information) is a protocol designed specifically for the communication of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) between systems. TAXII 2.1, which our application consumes, is an HTTPS RESTful API that uses JSON for data formatting and allows systems to exchange STIX content.

Key characteristics of TAXII 2.1:
- RESTful API using JSON payloads
- Supports HTTPS for transport security
- Provides discovery, collection, and API root services
- Enables polling for new intelligence
- Supports filtering of data during exchange
- Uses basic authentication (username/password)

## What are STIX Objects?

STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression) is a standardized language for representing cyber threat intelligence. Our feed consumption component processes these structured objects from external sources.

The STIX objects we primarily handle include:

### Indicators
Technical patterns that can be used to detect suspicious or malicious activity, such as:
- IP addresses (IPv4, IPv6)
- Domain names
- URLs
- File hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)
- Email addresses
- Registry keys

### Attack Patterns (TTPs)
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures used by threat actors, including:
- MITRE ATT&CK framework techniques
- Custom attack methodologies
- Malware behaviors

## How Feed Consumption Works

The feed consumption process follows these key steps:

1. **Connection Establishment**: The application connects to an external TAXII server using authentication credentials
2. **Collection Discovery**: The application identifies available collections on the TAXII server
3. **Polling**: The application polls a specified collection for content blocks
4. **STIX Processing**: The received content blocks are parsed and converted to STIX objects
5. **Entity Conversion**: STIX objects are converted to CRISP domain entities
6. **Deduplication**: The system checks for existing entities to avoid duplicates
7. **Storage**: New entities are stored in the database
8. **Notification**: Observers are notified of new threat intelligence

## Architecture Components for Feed Consumption

### Service Layer

#### StixTaxiiService
Base service that provides common functionality for TAXII operations:
- Establishing TAXII connections
- Discovering collections
- Parsing STIX content

#### OTXTaxiiService
Specialized service for AlienVault OTX TAXII feeds:
- Handles OTX-specific authentication
- Processes OTX STIX format
- Manages batched consumption for memory efficiency

### Repository Layer

#### IndicatorRepository
Handles storage and retrieval of threat indicators:
- Creating new indicators
- Updating existing indicators
- Checking for duplicates

#### TTPRepository
Handles storage and retrieval of TTPs:
- Creating new TTP records
- Updating existing TTPs
- Checking for duplicates

### Parser Component

#### STIX1Parser
Parses STIX 1.x XML content:
- Extracts indicator information
- Extracts TTP information
- Handles parsing errors gracefully

### Design Patterns Used

#### Factory Pattern
The `StixObjectCreator` hierarchy standardizes the creation of STIX objects:
- `StixIndicatorCreator`: Creates STIX indicators from raw data
- `StixTTPCreator`: Creates STIX attack patterns from raw data

#### Observer Pattern
The `ThreatFeed` as a subject notifies observers when new intelligence is consumed:
- `InstitutionObserver`: Notifies institutions about feed updates
- `AlertSystemObserver`: Triggers alerts based on feed updates

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Redis 6+
- RabbitMQ (for Celery)

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CRISP
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Create a .env file**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# Database settings
DB_NAME=crisp
DB_USER=myuser  # Replace with your PostgreSQL user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password  # Replace with your PostgreSQL password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# Django settings
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key  # Generate with: python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
DEBUG=True

# OTX API Key (for AlienVault OTX integration)
OTX_API_KEY=your_otx_api_key  # Get from otx.alienvault.com

# Redis settings
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

5. **Set up the PostgreSQL database**

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
CREATE DATABASE crisp;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE crisp TO myuser;
\q
```

6. **Apply migrations**

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations core
python manage.py migrate
```

7. **Create a superuser**

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Running the Application

### Start the Django Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

### Start the Celery Worker (for asynchronous feed consumption)

```bash
# Make sure Redis is running
redis-cli ping  # Should return PONG

# Start Celery worker
celery -A crisp worker -l info
```

## Consuming Threat Intelligence Feeds

### Setting Up a Feed through the Admin Interface

1. **Create an Institution**
   - Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)
   - Go to "Institutions" and click "Add Institution"
   - Fill in the details and save

2. **Create a Threat Feed**
   - Go to "Threat feeds" and click "Add Threat feed"
   - Fill in the details:
     - Name: "AlienVault OTX Feed"
     - Description: "External threat feed from AlienVault OTX"
     - Owner: Select your institution
     - Is External: Check this box
     - TAXII Server URL: "https://otx.alienvault.com/taxii"
     - TAXII API Root: "taxii"
     - TAXII Collection ID: "user_AlienVault"
     - TAXII Username: Your OTX API key
     - Is Public: Check if you want to share this feed
   - Save the threat feed

### Consuming the Feed via API

#### Start Consumption

Use the API endpoint to start the consumption process:

```bash
# Process in batches of 100 with data from the last 7 days
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/threat-feeds/1/consume/?force_days=7&batch_size=100"
```

#### Advanced Options

```bash
# Process in batches of 100 with data from the last 30 days
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/threat-feeds/1/consume/?force_days=30&batch_size=100"

# Process in the background (async mode)
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/threat-feeds/1/consume/?force_days=7&batch_size=100&async=true"

# Limit the number of blocks to process (for testing)
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/threat-feeds/1/consume/?limit=10"
```

#### Check Feed Status

```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/threat-feeds/1/status/"
```

This will show the number of indicators and TTPs, along with the last sync time.

## Data Flow: Threat Intelligence Consumption

1. The system connects to external TAXII feeds (such as AlienVault OTX)
2. It retrieves STIX-formatted threat intelligence data (indicators and TTPs)
3. The data is processed in batches to manage memory usage
4. Each item is parsed, converted to CRISP entities, and stored in the database
5. The system avoids duplicates by checking STIX IDs
6. Processing statistics are tracked and reported
