# CRISP SYSTEM INTEGRATION ROADMAP
**Timeline**: 7 Days  
**Team**: 5 Developers  
**Strategy**: Parallel Development with Minimal Conflicts

---

## PROJECT STRUCTURE & CONFLICT PREVENTION

### Branch Strategy
```
main branch
└── dev (ALL team members work here together)
```

**CRITICAL**: Everyone works on the `dev` branch simultaneously. To prevent conflicts:
1. **Frequent pulls**: Pull latest changes every 2-3 hours
2. **Small commits**: Commit changes frequently (every 1-2 hours)
3. **Immediate conflict resolution**: Fix conflicts immediately when they occur
4. **File ownership respected**: Only modify files in your designated area
5. **Communication**: Announce when modifying shared files (settings.py, urls.py)

### File Ownership Matrix (NO OVERLAP)

- Both systems have Organization models that conflict
- Need to create unified models that preserve ALL functionality from BOTH systems

CURRENT STATE:
- Core system uses: Organization, STIXObject, Collection, Feed, ThreatFeed, Indicator, TTPData
- Trust system uses: Organization, CustomUser, AuthenticationLog, UserSession, UserProfile
- Main conflict: Two different Organization models with overlapping but different fields

MY TASKS:
1. Analyze model conflicts and create unified schema that preserves EVERY field and method
2. Create migration scripts that merge data with ZERO data loss
3. Update foreign key relationships while maintaining ALL existing functionality
