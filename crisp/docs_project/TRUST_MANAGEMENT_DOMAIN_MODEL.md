# CRISP Trust Management Domain Model

## Overview

CRISP (Cyber Risk Information Sharing Platform) is a system designed to streamline and enhance threat intelligence sharing among organizations, particularly those in the educational sector facing increasing ransomware threats. The **Trust Management System** is a core component that establishes, maintains, and governs trust relationships between organizations to enable secure sharing of threat intelligence.

## Trust Management Architecture

The Trust Management System follows a modular, service-oriented architecture implementing several design patterns to ensure flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.

### Core Trust Management Components

#### 1. Trust Domain Model

The trust domain model consists of the following key entities:

- **TrustLevel**: Defines the three trust levels (Public, Trusted, Restricted) with associated permissions and anonymization levels
- **TrustRelationship**: Bilateral trust agreements between institutions with defined sharing permissions
- **TrustGroup**: Community groups enabling multi-institution trust relationships
- **TrustGroupMembership**: Associates institutions with trust groups and defines their roles
- **TrustLog**: Comprehensive audit trail for all trust-related access and administrative actions

#### 2. Trust Service Layer

The trust service layer manages business logic and operations:

- **TrustService**: Core trust relationship management and evaluation
- **TrustGroupService**: Manages trust groups and community relationships
- **AccessControlService**: Evaluates access permissions based on trust relationships
- **TrustAuditService**: Handles comprehensive logging and audit trail management

#### 3. Trust Repository Layer

Repositories handle trust data persistence:

- **TrustRelationshipRepository**: Manages storage and retrieval of trust relationships
- **TrustGroupRepository**: Manages trust group data and memberships
- **TrustLogRepository**: Manages audit trail and logging data

### Design Patterns Implementation for Trust Management

#### Strategy Pattern - Access Control Strategies

The Strategy pattern provides flexible access control algorithms based on trust relationships:

- **AccessControlStrategy** (interface): Defines access control evaluation interface
- **AccessControlContext**: Context class that uses strategies and holds request information
- **TrustBasedAccessControl**: Strategy for trust level-based access decisions
- **GroupBasedAccessControl**: Strategy for trust group-based access decisions
- **PolicyBasedAccessControl**: Strategy for rule-based access decisions
- **ContextAwareAccessControl**: Strategy considering time, location, and usage patterns

#### Factory Pattern - Trust Object Creation

The Factory Method pattern standardizes the creation of trust-related objects:

- **TrustObjectCreator** (abstract): Defines interface for creating trust objects
- **TrustRelationshipCreator**: Creates and initializes trust relationships
- **TrustGroupCreator**: Creates trust groups with appropriate defaults
- **TrustLogCreator**: Creates standardized audit log entries

#### Observer Pattern - Trust Event Notifications

The Observer pattern notifies stakeholders when trust relationships change:

- **TrustSubject** (interface): Defines subject interface for trust events
- **TrustRelationship** (concrete subject): Maintains list of observers for relationship changes
- **TrustObserver** (interface): Defines observer interface for trust notifications
- **InstitutionTrustObserver**: Notifies institutions about trust relationship changes
- **AlertSystemObserver**: Triggers security alerts based on trust violations
- **AuditObserver**: Ensures all trust changes are properly logged

#### Decorator Pattern - Trust Enhancement

The Decorator pattern dynamically adds capabilities to trust evaluations:

- **TrustEvaluationComponent** (interface): Defines the component interface
- **TrustEvaluationDecorator** (abstract): Base decorator class
- **SecurityEnhancementDecorator**: Adds additional security checks
- **ComplianceDecorator**: Adds regulatory compliance validation
- **AuditDecorator**: Adds comprehensive audit logging to trust decisions

## Trust Data Flow

### Trust Relationship Establishment

1. A **Publisher** (Institution Administrator) initiates a trust relationship request
2. The **TrustService** validates the request and creates a pending **TrustRelationship**
3. The target institution receives notification through the **Observer Pattern**
4. Upon acceptance, the **TrustService** activates the relationship
5. **TrustLog** entries are created for complete audit trail
6. All observers are notified of the relationship activation

### Trust-Based Access Control

1. A **User** requests access to threat intelligence from another institution
2. The **AccessControlService** creates an **AccessControlContext** with request details
3. The appropriate **AccessControlStrategy** is selected based on relationship type
4. The strategy evaluates access permissions considering:
   - Trust level between institutions
   - User's role and permissions
   - Requested resource sensitivity
   - Trust group memberships
   - Current security context
5. Access decision is returned with appropriate anonymization level
6. All access attempts are logged to **TrustLog** for audit purposes

### Trust Group Management

1. A **Publisher** creates or joins a **TrustGroup** for community sharing
2. The **TrustGroupService** manages group policies and membership
3. Trust relationships are inherited from group membership
4. Group-level sharing policies are applied to member institutions
5. Group activities are monitored and logged for governance

## Trust Management Class Relationships

### Core Trust Relationships

- **Institution** → has-many **TrustRelationship**: Institutions participate in multiple trust relationships
- **TrustRelationship** → has-one **TrustLevel**: Each relationship has an assigned trust level
- **TrustRelationship** → has-many **TrustLog**: All relationship activities are logged
- **TrustGroup** → has-many **TrustGroupMembership**: Groups contain multiple member institutions
- **Institution** → has-many **TrustGroupMembership**: Institutions can join multiple groups

### Service Layer Relationships

- **TrustService** → **TrustRelationship**: Service creates and manages relationships
- **TrustService** → **TrustRelationshipRepository**: Service uses repository for persistence
- **TrustGroupService** → **TrustGroup**: Service manages group operations
- **AccessControlService** → **AccessControlStrategy**: Service uses strategies for decisions

### Strategy Pattern Relationships

- **AccessControlContext** → uses **AccessControlStrategy**: Context delegates to strategy
- **AccessControlStrategy** ← implemented by concrete strategies: Implementation relationship
- **TrustBasedAccessControl** → accesses **TrustRelationship**: Strategy queries trust data
- **GroupBasedAccessControl** → accesses **TrustGroupMembership**: Strategy queries group data

### Observer Pattern Relationships

- **TrustRelationship** → implements **TrustSubject**: Relationships can notify observers
- **InstitutionTrustObserver** → implements **TrustObserver**: Institution notifications
- **AlertSystemObserver** → implements **TrustObserver**: Security alert generation
- **AuditObserver** → implements **TrustObserver**: Audit trail maintenance

## Trust Management Implementation Status

The current trust management implementation includes:

1. **Core Trust Models**:
   - TrustLevel (Public, Trusted, Restricted)
   - TrustRelationship (bilateral agreements)
   - TrustGroup (community groups)

   - Trust configuration management

## Trust Management Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Required for trust administrative functions
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Publishers, Viewers, and BlueVisionAdmins have different trust permissions
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access trust functions appropriate to their role

### Trust Relationship Security
- **Bilateral Approval**: Trust relationships require acceptance from both parties
- **Trust Revocation**: Immediate termination of trust relationships with security implications
- **Trust Escalation Monitoring**: Detection of suspicious trust relationship patterns
- **Trust Violation Response**: Automated response to trust policy violations

### Audit and Compliance
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All trust actions logged with immutable audit trail
- **Trust Governance**: Platform-wide trust policies enforced by BlueVisionAdmins
- **Compliance Reporting**: Regular reports on trust relationship status and activities
- **Forensic Capabilities**: Detailed investigation capabilities for trust violations

   - Machine learning-enhanced access decisions
   - Zero-trust architecture integration
   - Contextual access controls
