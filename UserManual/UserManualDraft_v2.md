## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I request access to the CRISP platform?**

A: Contact your organization's security administrator or IT department to request access. They will create your account, assign appropriate roles, and provide initial login credentials.

**Q: What browsers are supported?**

A: CRISP supports Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, and Microsoft Edge 90+. We recommend using the latest version of your preferred browser for optimal performance and security.

**Q: Can I use CRISP on mobile devices?**

A: Yes, CRISP features a responsive design that works on tablets and smartphones. However, the full desktop experience is recommended for complex tasks like content creation and administration.

### Account Management

**Q: How do I reset my password?**

A: Use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page, or contact your organization's administrator for assistance. Passwords must meet complexity requirements (minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols).

**Q: What should I do if my account is locked?**

A: Contact your organization's Publisher or Admin user to unlock your account. Account lockouts typically occur after multiple failed login attempts for security protection.

**Q: How do I enable two-factor authentication (MFA)?**

A: Navigate to your profile settings and follow the MFA setup wizard. We recommend using an authenticator app rather than SMS for enhanced security.

### Trust Relationships

**Q: How long does it take to establish a trust relationship?**

A: Trust relationship establishment typically takes 2-5 business days, depending on the complexity of the arrangement and response time from the partner organization. Simple bilateral trusts are usually faster than complex multi-party agreements.

**Q: Can I establish trust relationships with organizations outside my industry?**

A: Yes, cross-industry trust relationships are supported and often valuable for comprehensive threat intelligence. However, ensure that your organization's policies permit such relationships.

**Q: What happens if a trust relationship is terminated?**

A: When a trust relationship ends, access to shared information is immediately revoked. Previously shared data may be retained according to the agreed-upon data retention policies, but no new information will be exchanged.

### Content and Publishing

**Q: What file formats are supported for threat intelligence content?**

A: CRISP supports multiple formats including STIX/TAXII, CSV, JSON, XML, and PDF. The platform can also import and export data in various industry-standard formats.

**Q: How do I classify my content properly?**

A: Follow the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) guidelines: TLP:RED (internal use only), TLP:AMBER (limited sharing), TLP:GREEN (community sharing), and TLP:WHITE (public sharing). When in doubt, consult your organization's classification guidelines.

**Q: Can I schedule content publication for later?**

A: Yes, the platform supports scheduled publishing. You can set specific dates and times for content to be automatically published to your selected audiences.

### Technical Issues

**Q: Why is the platform running slowly?**

A: Performance issues can result from network connectivity, high system load, or browser cache problems. Try clearing your browser cache, checking your internet connection, or switching to a different browser. Contact support if issues persist.

**Q: How do I export large datasets?**

A: For large datasets, use the bulk export functionality with appropriate filters to limit data scope. Large exports are processed in the background, and you'll receive notification when your download is ready.

**Q: Can I integrate CRISP with my existing security tools?**

A: Yes, CRISP provides comprehensive APIs for integration with SIEM systems, threat intelligence platforms, and other security tools. Contact your administrator or technical support for integration assistance.

### Security and Compliance

**Q: How is my data protected?**

A: CRISP implements AES-256 encryption for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit, comprehensive access controls, and detailed audit logging. The platform meets industry security standards including ISO 27001 and SOC 2.

**Q: Can I delete my data from the platform?**

A: Data deletion policies vary based on content type and organizational agreements. Contact your administrator for information about data retention and deletion procedures specific to your organization.

**Q: How does CRISP comply with privacy regulations like GDPR?**

A: CRISP includes privacy controls for consent management, data subject rights, cross-border transfer safeguards, and automated data anonymization. Specific compliance features may vary based on your organization's configuration.

### Roles and Permissions

**Q: What can I do as a Viewer?**

A: Viewers have read-only access to threat intelligence, can export data, receive alerts, and view analytics dashboards. You cannot create content, manage users, or establish trust relationships.

**Q: How do I request additional permissions?**

A: Contact your organization's Publisher or Admin user to request role changes or additional permissions. Requests should include business justification and may require management approval.

**Q: Can I have different roles in different trust groups?**

A: Your role within trust groups is determined by your organizational role in CRISP. However, trust group administrators can configure specific permissions for group activities.

### Support and Training

**Q: Where can I find training materials?**
