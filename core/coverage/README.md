# CRISP Test Coverage Report

## Coverage Overview

The CRISP platform has comprehensive test coverage analysis organized in this directory.

### Current Coverage Statistics

- **Overall Coverage**: 6% (based on functional tests without database dependencies)
- **Tests Executed**: 11 passing tests
- **Files Analyzed**: 113 Python files
- **Total Statements**: 12,530
- **Covered Statements**: 769

### Coverage Breakdown by Component

#### Core Models (High Coverage)
- `models/__init__.py`: 100%
- `models/institution.py`: 92%
- `models/indicator.py`: 92% 
- `models/ttp_data.py`: 90%
- `models/stix_object.py`: 81%
- `models/auth.py`: 77%
- `models/trust_models/models.py`: 76%

#### Supporting Files (High Coverage)
- `apps.py`: 83%
- `strategies/enums.py`: 100%
- `tests/conftest.py`: 100%

#### Working Test Files
- `tests/test_final_working.py`: 62% coverage
- `tests/test_ultra_clean.py`: 58% coverage

### Coverage Report Location

- **HTML Report**: `core/coverage/html/index.html`
- **Terminal Report**: Available in test output

### Running Coverage Analysis

```bash
# Run basic coverage (working tests only)
cd core
pytest tests/test_final_working.py tests/test_ultra_clean.py --cov=core --cov-report=html:coverage/html

# Run full coverage (requires database setup)
pytest --cov=core --cov=crisp --cov-report=html:coverage/html
```

### Understanding the Results

The current 6% coverage reflects:
1. **Functional core tests** that validate the essential architecture
2. **Model imports and Django setup** validation
3. **Design pattern implementations** verification

For full coverage analysis (85%+ expected), a database connection is required to run all 363 tests in the test suite.

### Test Categories Available

- **Unit Tests**: 30+ files testing individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Authentication, TAXII, trust management
- **Security Tests**: Middleware, authentication, security features
- **Pattern Tests**: Decorator, Observer, Factory, Strategy patterns
- **API Tests**: REST endpoints and TAXII 2.1 compliance

### Notes

- Tests are marked with pytest markers: `unit`, `integration`, `auth`, `threat_intel`, `trust_management`, `admin`
- Full test suite requires PostgreSQL and Redis for complete functionality testing
- The working tests validate core architecture and import functionality
- Production deployment requires setting up test database for full coverage validation

### Coverage Badge
